# Changelog Policy

- Use Keep a Changelog style with semantic versioning when publishing.
- Every user-visible change must have an entry under Added, Changed, Fixed, or Removed.
- Link PRs/issues when possible; avoid prohibited terms in entries.
- Unreleased section accumulates changes until the next version bump.

## Unreleased

- Project under active development; crates are not published yet.
